# AgenticAI

AgenticAI is a Python-based project where I explore the concept of **agentic AI systems** — AI agents that can be organized into teams, assigned roles, and configured to work toward specific goals. This project is part of my learning journey in AI agents, automation, and intelligent systems.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how multiple AI agents can be defined, grouped, and managed using structured data files and Python logic. It focuses on experimentation, clean project structure, and gradual improvement rather than a finished product.
